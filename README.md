## standards that are not implemented:

### MIDI Modes (omni mode and poly/ mono mode)
As of right now, poly mode with omni on is assumed.

### pitch bend & sensitivity adjustment
Due to limit of MIPS simulator syscall, these are currently unuseful for the midi files I collected.

### And most of the controller messages
